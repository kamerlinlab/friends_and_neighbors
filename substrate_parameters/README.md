MD simulation parameters for both benzylpenicillin and cefotaxime (simulated in their tetrahedral intermediate forms). These are compatible with the AmberMD simulation program. For both sets of substrate parameters an example tleap script and input PDB file is provided to show how to use the parameters. 

Please see the manuscript for details on how the parameterisation was performed.
